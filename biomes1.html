	<h2>biomes</h2>
	<p>Six global dryland biomes were selected from  Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Olson et al. 2001);
	Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests;
	Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands;
	Temparate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands;
	Montane Grasslands and Shrublands;
	Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands, and Scrub;
	Deserts and Xeric Shrublands. Labelled landcover samples were taken from Stanimirova et al. (2023).
	The landcover samples were then filtered by biome.</p>
